# Codewars Ruby Katas

Hi, I am [Sjaak van den Berg](http://svdb.co/) and these are [my Ruby exercises](http://www.codewars.com/users/sjaakvandenberg) from [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/).

If you come across them and you're learning Ruby, try coming up with a solution yourself first and use my answers as a last resort. Some of these solutions might not be optimal or even complete or working. This is a small part of my journey learning the Ruby language.

Each Ruby file contains a small header, along with a description of the exercise. It will sometimes also include one or more alternative solutions. The syntax will generally follow standard Rubocop syntax linting, but might occasionally deviate in the alternative solutions.

For questions or suggestions, you can reach me on Twitter via [@svdb](https://twitter.com/svdb). Have fun learning Ruby!
